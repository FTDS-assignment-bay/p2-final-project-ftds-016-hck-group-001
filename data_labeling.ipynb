      "Can't stop charges to bank account Can't stop charges to bank account I took out a Loan from Cash Central XXXX, Al for {$300.00} sense that time I lost my job and also my medications went through the roof so I was unable to pay the Loan back. Every sense that time I have been receiving phone calls everyday. Not a day pass they are calling me and they always call from a different number so I never know who it is calling. They have caused me to pay out so much money at my Bank, at the time my Bank was XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Al. They have caused me to pay out hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees, money that I could have paid them with but they would not stop trying to debit my account. They call every day starting at around XXXX I am telling them the same thing each time they call me that I do not have any money to pay them now if I did have the money I would pay them each month until I paid them up but until my income increase I am not able to pay them. I am on a fix income and I can not pay them now and I can not tell you when I can pay because I do n't know my self. I am so tired of the harassing phone calls I am on XXXX and XXXX and every day it gets worse and worse and I ca n't keep putting up with them calling every day like this it works on my nerves and it up sets me really bad. I told XXXX people that call me that I would try to pay something next month and she screamed at me and said next month, why next month? I told her I had to see how my bills would run and I could not give her and amount so to how much I can pay. I know even if I could pay them it would not be more than {$4.00} or {$5.00} dollars if that much. They just keep calling and calling every day. They have been doing this for the pass 6 or 7 months and I ca n't take it any longer. My nerves are to bad and they runs my XXXX XXXX up by calling every day. If they were to slow down the calls except to may be once a month then that would be helpful a little but I still do n't know if I would have any money to pay them even then. I can try if I have any money left but I seriously doubt it not right now until my bills comes down. I am paying high bills right now and it is taking all of my money to just keep my house going so that I can have some where to live. It 's not that I do n't want to pay them but I do not have the money now. They ruined my Bank account and I had to close it because of all the over draft fees the Bank was charging me. Each day they sent the debit through for the {$300.00} and some dollars and every day the Bank charged me {$38.00} per transaction, I paid out a lot of money to the Bank for these transactions, money they could have had if they would not have kept trying to debit my account. I am so tired of this and I do n't know nothing else to do except not answer the phone but If I did that I could miss important phone calls from other people I need to talk to. I am just tired of the harassing phone calls. This is not good for my illness. Regardless of what I say to them they still call every day. I just want the calls to stop. I will pay something when ever I can. \n",

      "Dealing with my lender or servicer Received bad information about my loan Currently I have student loans with Genesis Lending from classes that I attended at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Wyoming from XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX. I am a veteran of the XXXX XXXX and as though I did receive benefits from my XXXX G.I. Bill, the money had to be used for living expenses since my husband and I were unable to receive campus housing due to our marriage status. Because of this, we were unable to use the G.I. bill for its intended use and now we are paying the student loans. Considering XXXX provided high hopes for attending the school, I became a XXXX GPA student and graduated with above and beyond characteristics. When I attended the introduction day where I had to sign tons of papers, I remember specifically them telling me to sign a paper for a private Genesis loan in which I had not been aware of. They wanted me to do this since I did n't not qualify for some other loan. The lady insisted that it was a good loan although I feel I did n't have much time to think about it and I feared that I would not be able to attend school if I did n't do this. I do n't remember going over interest rates or loan amounts but she did tell me they would wait till we graduated to pay them back. After graduation, I applied for many positions and did receive only XXXX call back. In addition my husband received XXXX. I became sole provider till he found a job but I was not properly prepared to work in the position I ended up getting as an XXXX at XXXX XXXX. My hands on teachings were out of date for the current repairs that I had to make on vehicles. I feel that my husband and I were ill-equipped for entering the XXXX as they had lead us on to be as well as my above and beyond attitude that I worked on while attending did not seem to have made a difference. I currently am a XXXX and both my husband and I feel that we did not receive enough or the right sort of education that would help us in the XXXX. We have felt like this for years. Our loans had been on multiple deferments and forbearance as well as while I did have a job, I do remember specifically XXXX instance where I received collectors calls and I had to tell them I could n't pay them back but the lady insisted that I make a payment that very day. The call ended in tears. Myself as well as my husband where not happy with our education as well as the position that we were left in when he could n't get a job and that we had to use the benefits money to pay for our living expenses at the time. We are still to this day trying to get ahead even with our loans on forbearance. \n",

I 've told my dad countless times that if he thinks he is not going to be able to make the payment to contact me before it becomes late so that I can try to cover the payment. However, that has not happened. My mom did let me know that due to my dad being out of work and without a car due to a car accident, that he will not be able to make a payment on time. \n",

How is that fair for a consumer who is only trying to do the right thing by repaying a loan that was never requested by her? Additionally, my request to Wells Fargo was to grant me access to view this account online, so that I do not find myself in the same predicament and wind up with another 30 day late reporting on my credit file. The representative, although pleasant, did not have any options to assist me.

Then to state I have to call in to request a statement each month is mind-boggling, BUT if a payment is behind, there is no hesitation in reporting this on MY credit file. I feel that this is not only unfair, by unlawful, and it feels they are putting me in a position where I always have to worry about whether this bill is going to be paid on time.

Shortly after, I was laid off from my job due to the economy and was unable to find a job for over a year so I used the card for gas & food during that time. I soon fell behind in the payments and most of the card debt was late payments and penalties. Unfortunately I had moved and I forgot about it when I started working again. CACH LLC bought the debt years later and sued me. I tried to explain my circumstances, that I was in school and did not make very much money and that I owned nothing. I 'm still driving the XXXX Impala that mother bought me when I was in high school. They refused to listen and threatened & intimidated me into signing an agreement to pay {$75.00} a month which I knew I could n't afford, but I had never had any dealings with the law so I was scared and thought I had to sign it. When I could n't pay it, they sued me. I know I have to pay it and I have been sending them {$25.00} a month but I lost my lease and had to move so I was unemployed again in XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. I worked odd, temporary jobs during that time and finally found another full time job in XX/XX/XXXX XXXX but I only make {$11.00} an hour and have been struggling to survive and catch up on my rent since then,. But I started paying the {$25.00} a month again then. But in XX/XX/XXXX, CACH froze my bank account and took my last {$190.00} out which meant I had no money for food and gas for over a week. When I read up on Florida Garnishment Rules, I saw that they are not supposed to be able to garnish a person 's salary if they make below a certain level and that includes their bank account if it can be proved that the money was income. The only money going into my bank account was my salary. I have tried to talk to them several times and even had my mother call them because I 'm not very informed about these matters, but they only say they are trying to collect a debt for their customer and wo n't agree to a lessor payment. It is not for a lot of money, only about {$2500.00} but I do n't have it and neither does my mother. She lost our house to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and we have both been trying to recover since then. We ca n't even afford a lawyer to fight them and feel like we are victims of the law and have no recourse against this unscrupulous company. We will pay the debt but we need time.

I would like to pay it in full now but there is no way i can do so. ( My Mother is writing this for me as I 'm not knowledgeable about these things ). \n",

I know I contacted you all after the fact but you did n't exist until XX/XX/XXXX. You made them write the note of satisfaction, so why not get my land back? I never signed my land over to them during my construction loan with XXXX and later became XXXX XXXX, did n't include it with my mortgage either. SunTrust made up this loan and how can they get away with it? This ca n't be legal.

      "Disclosure verification of debt Right to dispute notice not received I filed a complaint against Enhanced Recovery Corp on XXXX XXXX because ERC violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by failing to send me notice as required by the law before putting this account on my credit report. Your case no. is XXXX. ERC 's response to you was as follows : \" As a result of this complaint, ERC has updated the account as a disputed item and placed it in an investigatory status to prevent any further collection efforts. In acknowledgement of the dispute, we have requested the account be removed from all credit reporting agencies. Please allow up to 45 days for the credit reporting agencies to process our request. '' I called ERC on XXXX XXXX to confirm that a request had been submitted. XXXX XXXX XXXX (? ) of the Compliance Dept admitted to me on the XXXX that no such request had been sent ; that it would be sent on XXXX XXXX. I called XXXX and asked how the request would be processed and was told that the computer would automatically delete the account with no human processing required. I called all XXXX bureaus on Monday and the account had not been deleted. I called all XXXX bureaus today the XXXX and the account has not been deleted and they told me that no such request was received. I called ERC this morning and was told it sent the request electronically on the XXXX. ERC 's response to CFPB was that it had already sent the deletion request by the XXXX. It also lied to me because it told me it would actually send it on the XXXX. Since the account has not been deleted from any of the bureaus, it means the bureaus have not received such a request. So, as of XXXX XXXX, no such deletion was sent or completed. When I called ERC this morning it told me to wait 45 days. ERC knows as well as I do that if I had filed a dispute with the CB 's it would take 30 days to be investigated. That is not how a request for deletion is handled by the CB 's. ERC has not only been dishonest with me and you, it continues to break the law by leaving it on my report because the courts have ruled that putting that entry on my report constitutes collection activity which is not allowed once the account is disputed. This company operates in blatant disregard for the law. \n",

      "Charge-offs are required by statute for many creditors when a debt has reached a certain level of delinquency, usually 180 days.

      "Communication tactics Frequent or repeated calls Some months ago ( exact date not recalled ), I allowed my credit card to be used by a man and his wife ( who are long time friends ) for purposes of signing up for aXXXX XXXX account. Apparently they were very unhappy with the service and decided to return to XXXX XXXX with whom they had previously dealt. They contacted XXXX advising them of their desire to cancel service, and returned the equipment in packaging provided by XXXX via the XXXX Post Office, however the gentleman failed to obtain a return receipt for his own records. \n",
      "Ultimately XXXX XXXX denied having received the equipment and told the couple they would be charged for it accordingly. A dispute resulted and the couple refused payment or further responsibility, at which point the matter was turned over to some collection agency and from there to this current XXXX who eventually obtained my contact information and began making numerous calls to be, often as many as XXXX to XXXX calls in a single day. \n",

This continued for perhaps XXXX to XXXX different calls on various occasions, during which I repeatedly explained matters while also explaining my own extensive health problems and XXXX, but ASSURED that I would assume responsibility for the debt and further assure that it would NOT go unpaid ultimately, while further explaining that I first needed to get extra income available in order to meet existing expenses at moment. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was told that they would continue contacting me, and I told them that would be good and well on a reasonable periodic basis, but that the persistent and increasing number of calls on a daily basis was non-productive and could not accomplish anything of meaning either for themselves or my person in getting all of this taken care of. The gentleman at that time assured me that the constant and daily flow of calls would be addressed right away. Regretfully that never happened, and the calls have continued in spite of my efforts to stop them by \" blocking '' and other measures, however I no longer bother to respond because it apparently does n't mean anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of personal health, I have serious heart, respiratory, and central nerve issues all of which are admittedly being aggravated by the stress resulting from what has become a matter of sheer harassment, and while having done my utmost to address these matters in a fully responsible, considerate, and prudent manner it has seemingly been to no avail. I would most deeply appreciate whatever manner of relief might be available at this point, because the added stress is more than a little difficult to deal with at the moment please. \n",
      "\n",
      "Originally this dispute revolved around a claim by XXXX XXXX that the equipment returned had not been received, however the claim has since been made that the clamed charges are due to a matter of \" early termination '' leaving me to wonder if they are even clear concerning the stated nature of this entire issue. \n",

The second letter said all collection processes were going to stop until the debt could be verified. Now, this past week the bill collector started calling again demanding {$8000.00}. When I told him the amount was wrong, not within the laws of the state of Missouri, asked him not to call my cell phone anymore, he hung up on me. Today, my mother said Hunter Warfields office called my moms home phone asking for me which I found embarrassing because I had to explain why a bill collector was calling them. There number is listed in the white pages so I guess they are going around calling all my relatives. \n",

They have me delinquent because the charge was for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX even though I did n't get a bill until XXXX XXXX. Is it true that even if you make your payments you can still be sent to collections? it seems a bit odd that a creditor would rather take 50 % than the entire balance. If they are willing to take 50 % I could do that.. Do n't know what to do now, I had planned to send the Hosp, XXXX on the XXXX of XXXX, but I am being told that the Hosp and Collection agency can not accept the payment. It used to be that if a payment was refused by the creditor the creditor risked having the debt cancelled, has that changed? XXXX citizens have enough problems we do n't need any more. \n",

      "Can't repay my loan Can't decrease my monthly payments Perhaps this is a common problem. I have had private law school loans since 1998. These loans are currently split between XXXX service providers - XXXX ( formerly XXXX XXXX ) and Access Group ( ACS ). Since my loans went into repayment, I never missed a payment, and paid my full amount owed every month. However, in the last couple of years, I 've had some challenges. I had to take time off from full-time employment due to some health issues, and we needed to relocate for my husband 's job across the country. I had a baby. I needed to stay home for a while. With both loan providers, I was able to suspend the federal loans, but the private ones have been more problematic. I am told I have no other options with those at this point. The monthly for ACS is {$270.00} and the monthly for XXXX is {$230.00}. The financial stress on our family is significant because of this, as I am not bringing in an income and not receiving any type of unemployment assistance. The lenders claim I have no options. I asked if it might be possible for me to pay a lower amount each month until I obtain employment. The answer was no, that this would still be considered default, even if I paid XXXX-XXXX percent of the amount owed each month. Essentially paying a substantial portion counts for nothing. I feel that this makes no sense and is borderline predatory. It seems as if trying to work out an arrangement with them is impossible. I understand why people give up and do n't pay at all. However, I have excellent credit and it 's important to me to retain this. It 's going to wipe out our savings over the next few months. I think the unwillingness to work with clients during financial difficulties is a real problem. This is not credit card debt. Most of us with these loans are responsible consumers. The failure to work with an individual who is willing to pay the maximum possible in his/her current financial situation, is something that I felt was worth documenting.

They eventually turned it over to the collection agency ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ) 2 ) My family and I rented a XXXX BR apartment when we first returned to the US from XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), XXXX XXXX, MO. It was a 35 year old bldg. We bought a house and moved out XX/XX/XXXX. During our stay, the refrigerator door needed fixing, the kitchen sink backed up and blooding the kitchen and finally the ceiling over the bath tub fell down ( XXXX ) because the bath rm above us leaked water which collected on top of our collapsed ceiling. Our family consisted of me, my wife and an XXXX year old daughter. We did not have any pet and we we are very considerate professionals. When we moved out, the property management did not return our deposit of {$250.00}. Not only that, a month later, sent us a bill of {$800.00} for replacement of the carpet which had normal wear and tear. They never showed me any pictures of the carpet or asked me if I would pay for it. Six months later, I started getting letters from the collection agency ( Consumer Collection, MN XXXX ) \n",

      "Communication tactics Threatened to take legal action this is from a medical procedure I had on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and again on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The debt is from a XXXX XXXX. I do not deny the debt whatsoever. The debt was for {$2100.00}. two separate times of {$1000.00}. each for their part in this procedure. We paid {$25.00} per month from XXXX/XXXX/XXXX thru XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at which time we never received another bill from that time to the present, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. We never received a letter, phone call or correspondence of any kind till that day of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when I received a Summons to court. It also had a letter attached to it that stated it was from a collection agency trying to collect a debt. I made a phone call on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to the number given that was supposed to be the Law office of XXXX XXXX XXXX, attorney at law here in XXXX, TN. I talked with a woman named XXXX XXXX who informed me she was an assistant for XXXX XXXX XXXX, and that she could set me up on a pay schedule, I informed her I was already on a pay schedule and that I was no longer receiving a bill. She informed me they were not required to send a bill. I informed her I had received a bill for 10 months in a row, that pretty much sets a precedence that they send a bill. That 's when she informed me I was going to have to pay court costs and she added it to my original debt. These people never gave me any opportunity to answer this debt at all, much less the first thing I hear from them is by a summons. The Dr. and the hospital who were involved in this same procedure are very close to being paid in full. This debt would be paid right down with them if they had continued to send us a bill. I checked with XXXX and with Optima Recovery and they both assured me they do send bills regardless what XXXX XXXX contends from The attorneys office. I have a severly XXXX that we have been working and waiting on the VA for 2 yrs. now to get the operations I need. It 's been longer than that since I could work. My wife lost her good paying job in XX/XX/XXXX and she has had to work with a temp service just to be able to have some kind of employment. Yet we paid each and every bill so it upsets me greatly when someone tries to cheat us like this and add some supposed court costs to our debt, when we have not gone to court. Not quite sure why they quit sending us a bill but if they had we would have continued paying it. When anything medical quits coming in you figure the insurance finally paid. Please give a reply, I believe I am being railroaded into paying court costs. \n",

I told the Bank that I never signed a note stating that I borrowed that money for rental or renovation properties. This has been a nightmare ever since those banks merged. I never had a proper closing, my attorney died, my builder had to move on to another job out of town, the company that sold the house filed Chapter XXXX and we had to apply to XXXX County for a Certificate Of Occupancy to move in our new home.

This notice also must include the name of the creditor to whom you owe the money, and how to proceed if you do n't think you owe the money. '' I never received any notice. Subsequently, The FCRA also protects consumers from the misreporting of information on your credit report. If a debt collector or credit bureau reports incorrect or inaccurate account information, it is violating the FCRA. Examples of violations include failing to report that a debt was discharged in bankruptcy and reaging old debt to extend the statute of limitations. In this case, it is definitely apparent that a collection agency or Credit bureaus can most definitely mix up similar credit files and misreport information.

They connected her and the courthouse which backfired on them as she learned she could make payments to the courthouse. She called my wife after the phone call and asked how she wanted to pay- my wife responded- to the courthouse. The woman told her she did not have time if we wanted to take the \" offer '' my wife said put your offer in writing and provide 30 days and they refused. They still claim they emailed the details the previous Friday which was a lie. This companies name turned out to be Nations Recovery Center Inc in XXXX GA.

A party who has lost something due to fraud is entitled to file a lawsuit for damages against the party acting fraudulently, and the damages may include punitive damages as a punishment or public example due to the malicious nature of the fraud. Quite often there are several persons involved in a scheme to commit fraud and each and all may be liable for the total damages. Inherent in fraud is an unjust advantage over another which injures that person or entity. It includes failing to point out a known mistake in a contract. There is a known mistake in a contract that was never pointed out to me by my broker. It also includes failing to not reveal a fact which he or she has a duty to communicate, such as not delivering promised amenities. My broker promised amenities including a tanning bed and garages as originally understood. The amenities of a tanning bed and garages were not delivered to me as promised. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty such as lying about advertising amenities that were not delivered. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty without direct proof of fraud or fraudulent intent. Extrinsic fraud occurs when deceit is employed to keep someone from exercising a right, such as a fair trial, by hiding evidence or misleading the opposing party in a lawsuit. \n",

I was informed I would pay an early cancellation penalty since I did not keep the service for the two year period. I informed the Customer Service representative I did not commit to a two year agreement and this was the first I was hearing from them. I did not receive any correspondence from XXXX at the time I agreed to the service with the XXXX representative. I received monthly bills from XXXX. I contacted XXXX several times after I cancelled my service to get an explanation to the charges. I returned the equipment in the prepaid postage container, but was not credited for the equipment. The remainder of the balance was said to be \" unpaid charges to XXXX ''. I asked twice for an explanation and received the same explanation. I was then contacted by a debt collector, XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX . I explained the situation to them ; however, they persisted with repeated telephone calls and correspondence. I responded to The XXXX XXXX with a letter providing the details and copies of billing statements from XXXX and XXXX. The XXXX billing statement showed no balance due. I received a response from XXXX XXXX along with a letter from XXXX. The letter from XXXX stated the XXXX and XXXX statements were integrated and XXXX and XXXX removed the XXXX billing option ( which occurred shortly after XXXX XXXX XXXX acquired XXXX ). The letter when on to state, \" The account balance includes XXXX charges which were unpaid by XXXX. '' I sent a subsequent letter to XXXX XXXX stating the collection of unpaid charges in between XXXX and XXXX. I requested XXXX XXXX stop all communication with me and with my address, and record that I dispute having any obligation for this debt. I informed XXXX XXXX that if they stop collection of the debt, and forward or return it to another company, to please indicate to them that the debt is disputed. Additionally, I asked if the debt is reported to a credit bureau, or already has been reported, also report that the debt is disputed. I did n't hear back from XXXX XXXX. About six weeks ago I received a telephone call from Focus Receivables Management. I returned the call and asked what this was in reference to. The agent stated she need personal information from me before I she could tell me what this was about. I refused to provide them with personal information and asked them to forward written correspondence. I continue to receive daily phone calls with voice mail messages. One of which was very personal in nature ( I have a copy of voice mail ). This past week I received written correspondence from Focus Receivables indicating the debt was with XXXX. In addition to phone calls to my residence, I now receive phone calls to my cell phone. When you answer the call, no one is there, the phone clicks, and you hear dial tone. \n",

I have not had phone service for over 5 years and was not even aware the pedestal was on the property, however I am told it is out of the easement by my surveyor. The pedestal was apparently run over by an unknown party travelling on the road. It had not been maintained by XXXX and was not visible. I have no other information other than I contacted XXXX to report the damage and was told that I was not responsible as it was outside of the home ( anything from the home inside is my responsibility - wiring, etc. ) I was told they would take care of it. They did not and there was jagged metal from the metal box adjacent to my drive where I enter and exit the property. We placed the metal in the trash for removal. After that, the XXXX repair techs came and cut-off the lines ( I guess ) and filled the hole with dirt. I was then sent a bill in the mail for {$1600.00}. I responded with a letter explaining the circumstances and received no further correspondence until a bill collector from JNR Adjustment began calling my work phone and leaving messages. I have attempted to resolve this through XXXX directly and they told me I would have to PROVE I did not damage the property! How can that be the American justice system? Guilty until I can prove I am innocent?????? It is their equipment, abandoned and damaged and I am the easiest target? How about they be required to prove I DID damage it. Which they can not, because I did not. I think they should accept the responsibility for not maintaining their own equipment and stop harassing me. Please help. \n",

My insurance company informed me to file a formal report with them because this was a known scam to them. These calls have persisted and they have some how gotten more and more person medical information about me and even now know where I live. The calls went from just other states to right here in my home town. Some of these numbers pop up on google with some pretty scary web links. ( I never open them ) My problem started after I started rejected there calls and after telling them I had reported them. Insurance company told me to tell them this. I then started getting calls from RPM, Receivables Management Performance. At XXXX I thought it was the same scam XXXX from before so I did n't answer. They started leaving numerous messages stated they were RPM a debt collecting company trying to collect a debt. Knowing that All my debt is paid off I immediately went to check my credit score. There it shows I XXXXwireless XXXX. How ever the phone account is n't in my name. Never has been. Nor under my social. So I found this very odd. It then said the original company charged me in XXXX XX/XX/2014 for the XXXX but never received. So I went to our phone statements knowing were not behind looking for this charge. XXXX never charged XXXX for any services additional to our normal bill. Payment history shows every payment has been made on time. I also never received calls from XXXX. I have tried answering the calls from RPM. They either announce who they are and then hang up, Hang up the XXXX I answer, or speak some other language real quick then hang up. Either way they never actually try to collect nor let me dispute the charges. They call every day between XXXX times. Different numbers. This is the absolute only debt I have showing on my credit and like I said before XXXX is not my account. I 've never had any wireless company account in my name. I looked this company up.

As was necessary, she obtained several loans over the period of four years. As her parents, we co-signed her loans. After college we made repeated attempts to consolidate her loans. The response was \" not possible ''. The result was XXXX loans, each due on different time of the month, all accruing interest. We attempted to set up a regular schedule, and, new to the workforce, she did her best to meet the loan payments. We helped as we could to offset the payments. Since 2004, we have consistently received letters and harsh, demanding phonecalls, sometimes threatening, even though we know the amount was regularly late, but paid in accordance with her and our pay checks. Had we known a student loan from Iowa Student Loans, now Aspire would be so physiologically demanding, we would never have used them. Even the credit card companies have been willing to work with us on consolidating and paying off a card. We have attempted numerous times to talk with the Iowa Student Loans, now Aspire to consolidate and make it easier for our daughter, and now us, to repay the loans. They are unrelenting, offering no options and constantly sending letters and telephone calls. We know the loans are being paid, however, if they are off by only a few days, even due to holidays, the phone calls and cautionary letters arrive. We have come to simply tossing the letters and hanging up on the calls. There seems to be no solution outside of obtaining a high interest private loan to get them off our back. That is not fair to the intent of education. Something must be done. \n",

Every month is a struggle to make the Social Security XXXX, now Social Security due to my age, last more than a few days into the month. These banks need to leave me alone. Bank of America should never have sold this nonexistent mortgage. I communicated all of this information to Bank of America, countless times, and then, to XXXX.

      "XXXX XXXX XXXX GA XXXXComplaint Description : The National Credit Systems , Inc. states that I owe on account # XXXX a total of {$3600.00}. The account in question is from an apartment that had an agreement terminated XX/XX/XXXX. I discovered this debt by checking my credit report and inquiring about it. On my credit it shows as debt owed beginning XX/XX/XXXX, however it should be changed to the correct date of XX/XX/XXXX. No attempt has ever been made to reach me regarding this debt that began XX/XX/XXXX. I had cosigned for an apartment for a friend of mine and was never notified of the failure to pay a debt. The person who rented the apartment, informed the apartment management that she was unable to afford the apartment and that she would be terminating the agreement early. She was told that if she left within three days that she would only be charged the early termination fee of {$2400.00} and no other fees. She left within three days per their agreement and made an arrangement to pay {$100.00} per month until the debt was paid off. In addition to the deposit on the apartment that paid off {$220.00} toward the termination fee, she made one payment of {$100.00} XX/XX/XXXX and did not make payments afterward. Once I found out about my credit score I called National Credit Systems to resolve issue. They state that instead of the {$2400.00} ( minus the {$100.00} payment and the {$220.00} deposit ), we also owe {$1200.00} for less than 60 day notice, pro-rated rent at {$32.00}, {$180.00} for cleaning charges, {$3.00} in damages, and {$19.00} in water/sewage which brings us to a total of {$3900.00} ( minus the {$220.00} deposit ). We should not have to pay the {$1200.00} for not giving 60 days notice as the arrangement with management was to leave within 3 days to avoid these charges, and she met that arrangement. In addition to the complaints, I have contacted this company and was met with extreme hostility. They yell over me when I merely ask questions regarding this debt which is news to me. They hang up on me frequently. They are rude, condescending, and insulting. At this point, when I call them they simply put me on hold until they eventually hang up on me. The company agreed to consider the debt settled at XXXX % ( {$2500.00} ), and yet when I asked for that agreement to be made in writing prior to payment, they refused saying that I must take their oral agreement and nothing else. I do not trust them to keep their agreement without seeing something in writing. To reiterate, I would like National Credit Systems , Inc. to provide to the three credit reporting agencies the actual beginning date of this debt XX/XX/XXXX and not XX/XX/XXXX that they reported previously. I would also like the agreement they made with me at considering this debt settled at XXXX % to be put in writing prior to payment. \n",

She has placed a Lien on my property for a debt that is below the amount of XXXX dollars which is not at all how collection agencys treat people with debts.

      "False statements or representation Attempted to collect wrong amount While working in XXXX several years ago I stayed at an apartment complex called \" XXXX ''. After fulfilling my lease obligations, I moved back to my home in XXXX were my family stayed during this two year long work assignment. I paid my last lease payment in full, professionally cleaned the apartment and did not think anything else was owed. A month later I went to the apartment complex and turned in my gate pass which I accidentally took with me and took to the day manager, we were friends. At that time there was no information shared on any money owed from my lease and I did n't expect there would be any. I received regular email correspondence from the XXXX complex about social activities and nothing about money owed. Over a year later I started getting collection attempts from National Credits Systems over {$210.00} owed from XXXX XXXX. I called XXXX to find out what was going on but apparently the apartment complex was sold to XXXX XXXX in XXXX and while they had a statement showing {$210.00} was never paid, nobody could answer what some of the charges were far. Nobody was able to help me since they sent the balance due to National Credit Systems. At one point when I was speaking with the collection agency, I identified some items that I may have paid if had known about it but other charges were still not identifiable. I told NCS that I would agree to pay this amount if they would remove the negative remark from my credit score but the agent said she could not. Known of this was my fault yet my credit is penalized for a mistake that the apartment complex made and then correcting this is impossible because it was sold to a residential management business. A consumer should never have to pay for something that they do not owe and to be penalized for this {$210.00} does more to protect business than protect consumers. The burden of proof that all attempts to contact the consumer who is alleged to have not paid for something owed should be on the business.

I told them to give a day and I would have it for them. I called back the next day and spoke to a new representative who told me that they would not remove the XXXX debts from my credit report and then my balance owed changed to XXXX dollars total. when I explained that the balance was not correct and I was also assured that my debt was supposed to be removed upon full payment of both debts, and that I wanted to speak to a supervisor, she hung up on me. Since that time I have been consistently calling trying to take care of this debt and I have not been able to reach anyone since. \n",

      "Communication tactics Threatened to take legal action I have been working with accelerated receivables since XX/XX/XXXX. I set up payment arrangements and I would pay extra, possibly pay off if I had enough from my tax return. In XX/XX/XXXX they did not take their monthly payment, I attempted to call the rep dealing with my account ( alex ) but she never picked up or called me back. I would get random unknown XXXX number calls and when I would pick up I would be on hold with an automated system for 10-15 minutes and be disconnected. I gave up trying to figure out why they stopped making payment arrangements as I tried to contact them for weeks. On XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX called me from Accelerated Receivables and informed me my account was turned over to the legal department and she was now handling my account. I told her I tried getting back in touch but no one would call me back, she dismissed me and told me that if I did n't pay the balance in full or promise to set auto payments of XXXX a month to pay off in 10 months she was going to garnish my wages. I told her I could not afford this, I am the only one working and have XXXX kids and a house payment. She said that there was nothing she could do, I either did what she said or she would proceed to garnish my wages. I asked her to give me a day to figure things out. At this point I was panicking, I did n't know what to do. I called her 5 times that day to see about me making a lump sum payment to bring the balance down and smaller payment arrangements. She never called me back. I did n't hear back from her until I called another 3 times the next day. She finally called me back around XXXX. I let her know that I could not find a way to make this work and offered to make a large payment and small payment arrangements she said she could not do that, now that it is in the legal dept. I called her again on XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had to call through another rep who claimed to sit by her and asked him keep me on the line until she was available. When XXXX picked up I told her that the best I could do was {$900.00} that day and auto payments of {$150.00}. She was rude and said with a stern voice, \" if you do not pay this off in 10 months we will garnish your wages, if you pay {$900.00} today it will bring your monthly payments to XXXX '' I tried to explain I felt this was unfair since I had been trying to get a hold of them since THEY stopped the payment arrangement, not me. She begun to talk over me and would n't let me finish my sentence. I told her I once again had to call her back. At this point I decided to do some research to see what I could do, I found out that I am able to go back to the original creditor and set up payments with them. I did speak with the hospital who agreed to set up {$150.00} payments a month and they informed the collection company that this was done, that it was n't working out with them to collect the payments. XXXX attempted to call me one time after this was done, I could n't answer since I was at work, she did not leave a message or call back since. I feel she was pressuring me and bullying me to get the account paid off before the end of the year. She threatened multiple times to take legal action to garnish my wages. \n",

Five years later in XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from the National Credit Audit Corporation ( NCAC ) saying that I owed {$270.00} for damage that had occurred to the apartment that I was living in while in college. I took the letter to my legal department because it seemed weird that an agency would contact me almost five years later about a claim that had materialized out of thin air. My legal department advised me that it was probably a debt collector scam that they unfortunately see frequently with military members due to the frequent moves inherent with military life. Legal told me to respond asking for more information about the debt assuming that it would fall by the wayside. NCAC responded with an itemized list of maintenance charges ( from XXXX XXXX properties, the apartment complex that I had previously lived in ) that I had never seen before. The list was dated a full month before I had supposedly vacated the apartment and yet I was only seeing it for the XXXX time five years later. When I had vacated the apartment in XX/XX/XXXX, it had been under good standing with the rental company ; I understood that I would not be getting the full amount of my initial deposit back because it was standard practice to repaint the walls and have the carpets cleaned using the initial deposit. I again consulted my legal department who, after some research found that XXXX XXXX properties and therefore NCAC, were in violation of Title VI Chapter 83 section 83.49 paragraph 3 ( A ) of the XXXX Statutes which states \" the landlord shall have 30 days to give the tenant written notice by certified mail to the tenant 's last known mailing address of his or her intention to impose a claim on the deposit and the reason for imposing the claim.If the landlord fails to give the required notice within the 30-day period, he or she forfeits the right to impose a claim upon the security deposit. '' XXXX XXXX properties failed to notify me within 30 days, much less via certified mail to my last known address, which was provided, and so in my opinion, the debt for damages ( that seem to have materialized when I was not around to contest them ) is not a valid claim. \n",

Why was I forced to choose between a validation or dispute? The notices says dispute the validity of the debt within 30 days or it 's assumed mine. The letter does not state it has to be sent in writing so why was XXXX trying to force me to send it in writing when I clearly disputed it verbally various times? Section 809 of the FDCPA does only require that the collection agency validate in writing when the request for validation is done in writing. But as per the notice I received there is no specific request nor requirement of the dispute or the request for validation to be placed in writing so therefore I feel as though this collection agency is poking fun at the FDCPA.

Being that a dispute and request of validation are both a form of a dispute they still need to be treated differently as well as investigated properly which this company refused to do.

      "Disclosure verification of debt Right to dispute notice not received My wife gave birth to our son in XXXX, 2014, which was a high risk procedure and led to significant expense. We received numerous medical bills and thought we had paid all of them. However, XXXX remained for original creditor, XXXX XXXX, MD, which went to collections in XXXX 2014. The original balance was {$600.00}. My wife was contacted by the debt collection agency, Allied Collection Services, in XXXX, and they advised her that, unless she went into their office within 2 days, they would be forced to take legal action against her. She was understandably upset, so she went into their office, infant in tow, where they convinced her to sign several forms, including setting up a payment plan. She setup the payment auto-debit, according to their terms as they discussed in the office, and they withdrew a couple payments. However, in or around XXXX 2014, Allied filed suit and obtained a judgment against her, claiming she had not honored the terms of the payment arrangement. Upon review of the payment documentation, they required an initial payment of {$50.00} and subsequent payments of {$25.00} per month. My wife was led to believe that she only needed to setup the auto-debit for {$25.00} per month so she \" missed '' the first payment. Upon securing judgment against my wife, Allied Collection Services secured a wage garnishment order against me as well. Upon being advised by my employer of the wage garnishment, my wife contacted Allied Collection Services to attempt to resolve the matter, but they refused to offer any reasonable alternatives ( other than payment in full along with significant additional collection costs ). My wages were garnished until XXXX 2015, at significantly more than {$25.00} a month. At no time did Allied Collection Services ever attempt to contact me prior to, during, or after garnishing my wages, which seemed like a fairly straightforward and simple thing to do. Nevertheless, I did not believe I had any option and allowed the garnishment to proceed. Upon completion, they secured enough money to nearly double the original debt. Further, although Allied had never made any contact with me, or attempted to do so that I am aware, they placed a derogatory tradeline in my credit file, the only such derogatory information in my credit report, and significantly impacting my credit for the next 7 years. I feel it is unconscionable that they were allowed to do as much as they did without first attempting to contact me. It was unconscionable that they created such a false sense of urgency for my wife when they knew full well that they could arrange a payment plan with her over the phone. It was unconscionable that they were so aggressive, so quickly after receiving the collection account, and that they said XXXX thing about the payment plan requirements but embedded different information in the fine print of the documents they pressured my wife to sign. And it is preposterous that I was forced to pay nearly double the original debt, which had not even been with them for 1 month at the time they secured judgment. \n",

I even threatened to call the police to no avail. It was as if they were protecting their client from being identified. They would not give me the name of the mortgage company allowing me to make contact. I had to research the county records to find out whom the previous mortgage holder was. I found FlagStar Bank had held the previous mortgage so I called XXXX and when they asked whom my mortgagor was I told them Flagstar bank, they then confirmed that it was Flagstar Bank that I need to make pay or make arrangements with.

I gained what i feel was a great relationship with the management team and worked very closely to a worker by the name of XXXX. Due to my mother having XXXX XXXX and becoming sickly I ended up having to move back to XXXX in a emergency. I spoke to XXXX and a few others that worked there about my personal information whereas an agreement came about to me being able to leave a bit earlier due to my situation. They informed me that the best they can do was for me to write a letter giving my 30 day notice so they can put the apartment back on the market preventing them from losing revenue and I can leave after the 30th day. In between time I was not aware that new management was taking over. Workers changed etc. When I spoke to the new workers they made it seem like everything was okay. I am trying very hard to fight what is right. If you look at my rental history I have never owed anyone and not pay them. Even if you look into my credit history if I came to a bump in the road I paid it up. It is not fair to me to be informed certain information in agreement and understanding especially when they see I pay my rent which was the reason why they even allowed me to leave because I have done good by them. Now they are saying I owe XXXX dollars for an apartment that cost XXXX a month. I left in XX/XX/XXXX and my lease was up in XX/XX/XXXX. This is incorrect, very incorrect and I have no idea where these numbers are coming from. I feel like I am being scammed and the credit bureaus wont do a thorough investigation. They need to contact management who was there when I resided there in hopes that they remember my case to assist me with these fraudulent charges. I work very hard for my money and would take them to court before I let someone be so immoral just to take money from me that i rightfully do n't owe. I do n't mind paying any debt I have back as you can see. Please assist me with this situation.

They then responded to the CFPB saying that we had successfully resolved the issue. Although we agreed upon a repayment rate Hunter Warfield refused to provide me with an agreement letter stating the terms of the repayment. They also refused to provide me with a receipt for the each payment that I made. In my mind this is not full resolution. I would like a letter stating the terms of the new agreement.

      "Disclosure verification of debt Not given enough info to verify debt On or about XXXX/XXXX/2015 I contacted National Credit Systems Inc. and spoke with XXXX XXXX at XXXX Ext. XXXX concerning XXXX or XXXX debts of the same account that appeared on XXXX public credit reports. I questioned the validity of the debts and the amounts owed. XXXX XXXX PROMISED to mail, to my home address which I provided during the conversation, an official document detailing the amounts owed, the original creditor and a statement guaranteeing that the debt amount would be updated on XXXX credit reports if I paid in full. XXXX XXXX explained that this was an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained would be used for that purpose. I was told the document would be mailed within a few days. Today, XXXX XXXX, 2015, I viewed XXXX public credit reports and noted that the last reported date had been changed from XXXX/XXXX/2011 to XXXX/XXXX/2015. Instead of providing me with an official document or notice that the debt was owed, National Credit Systems Inc. updated their data with XXXX credit reporting agencies as an malicious attempt to place negative data on my credit report for an additional 7 years. The original negative information was scheduled for deletion approximately less than 1 year from the date that I called them to resolve the matter. I have contacted the original creditor prior to contacting National Credit Systems Inc. and was told that they no longer own the debt. My contract is with the original creditor, XXXX. I have no contract with National Credit Systems Inc. and they refuse to provide with any documentation to support their claim of ownership or purchase of the debt. In good faith I was attempting to resolve this matter. I provided my name, address, SSN, date of birth, employer, and both cell phone and home telephone numbers. \n",

      "The debt itself is misleading as it appears on XXXX public credit reports. It is documented as owing {$500.00} and then {$3600.00}. There is a third entry showing an amount owed of {$4100.00}. Per XXXX XXXX of National Credit Systems Inc., the full amount owed is actually {$4100.00}. My interpretation based on the manner the debt ( s ) are documented is that I owe someone, a total of {$8200.00}. In my opinion, considering the amount that this collection agency claims I owe them for debt that they intercepted from the original creditor, a letter or formal communication of some sort is not an unreasonable request. If I request an email or regular mail statement in an attempt to pay a debt, there is no reason for the creditor to penalize me and ruin my credit for an additional 7 years. I called them. According to XXXX XXXX, \" we had no way to contact you and the debt would have disappeared within months ''. The tactics used by National Credit Systems Inc. appear to be malicious and unfair in nature in terms of making promises and not following through as well as and most importantly not providing PROOF and descriptions identifying themselves as the actual debt collector and owner. If I had paid in full National Credit Systems Inc. on or about XXXX/XXXX/2015, there would not have been any guarantee that at a later date the original creditor or some other collection agency would not have contacted me claiming ownership of the same debt and demanding payment, therefore starting the process over again. \n",

      "Disclosure verification of debt Right to dispute notice not received I went to the doctor for a medical condition with XXXX. I completed all of the necessary paperwork and the doctor 's office filed a claim on my behalf which was supposed to have been sent to the insurance company ( XXXX ). I never heard anything back from the doctor 's office after that nor did I get any information from the insurance company stating that I owed any money. Shortly after that visit I moved to a new address and never received a bill from the insurance company or the doctor. About one year later, I was checking my credit reports and I find XXXX entries of collection on my reports. XXXX was from PDQ Services Inc and the other was from XXXX but with the PDQ Services address and information. I immediately called the doctor office and was told that there was nothing they could do and that I would have to call PDQ. I immediately called PDQ and offered to pay the bill in order to get it off of my credit reports as I did n't want my credit tarnished from a {$230.00} bill. PDQ was paid via credit card online. After that I still noticed that PDQ had the information on my credit report and I told them that I thought this violated my privacy rights and HIPAA as it showed my potential medical condition. I asked that the entire credit line be removed from my reports as it was paid and served no purpose based on the fact that I never received a notice of a bill. Neither PDQ, XXXX or the credit reporting agencies wanted to listen to my plea. I honestly feel that I have been taken advantage of and become a victim of shoddy medical collection practices. I also think that the doctor never attempted to contact me as this could have easily been paid in the early stages if only I had been contacted. I asked the credit reporting agencies to verify the methods and they basically gave me a nonchalant answer. They claimed to have verified the collection but could n't have as PDQ and the doctor sent me a letter stating that they were not going to address my complaint. Everyone ignored my pleas after I paid the account and all they wanted was their money. They had no concern for my rights as a citizen. The credit reporting agency says that they mask reports when sending out medical information but I am inclined to disagree as I see poor reporting from them each time I look at my credit reports now. PDQ does not bargain in good faith and should have never had my medical information in the first place as they have no business associate agreement with the doctor. I asked for this but it was never given which leads me to believe that they are handling sensitive information without a need. I asked them to verify the debt after the fact and they only sent me a letter stating that the debt had been paid in full. All in all, this has been one unpleasant situation to be in as a result of a {$230.00} medical collection debt. \n",

An extra XXXX cents in XXXX, a XXXX instead of a XXXX in another, things that might seem like innocent typos, but which suggest also an attempt to look at the demand as a new claim. There was XXXX medical visit, and XXXX bill for services rendered, which was addressed by the insurer. And each time the debt collectors send a demand, it comes from another entity, most recently Central Credit Services with a XXXX mailing address for correspondence and an XXXX XXXX paying address ( the same address as the most recent XXXX demand from XXXX ). Most recently the claim is listed as XXXX of XXXX XXXX, who it appears obtained it from XXXX. This claim continues to be on my credit report, despite requests that they correct this.

I was then told that, because I do n't have a Wells Fargo checking account, that my payment would have to be refunded by mail, which would take \" a minimum of 3 weeks. '' I was having this conversation with Wells Fargo Customer Service on XXXX/XXXX/2016, 6 days after the XXXX due date. This meant that Wells Fargo 's own process for refunding a payment that should have applied to XXXX would indeed have made me delinquent for the month. Is it fair that a financial institution can structure payments and refunds in such a way that it makes an otherwise responsible and timely customer delinquent on their debts? I raised this question to the Wells Fargo staff who informed me this was \" just the way it is. '' To which I responded with skepticism, saying that this new system was probably just an inventive way of generating late fee revenues in a low interest rate environment. The representative said nothing. \n",
      "\n",
      "I called Wells Fargo again today, XXXX/XXXX/2016, to ask about the status of the refund. I was told it would be returned in the same manner in which I paid -- electronically to my non Wells Fargo checking account. This is welcome news but in direct contradiction to what I was assured was the only method of refund just 1 business day prior. Even the representative today could n't explain the change ( which had not been pro-actively communicated to me in any way -- as far as I knew I should be watching for a paper check in the mail in 3 weeks time ). Was the initial response on Friday a way to make me open an account with Wells Fargo that I otherwise would n't have? I have no idea but the inconsistency is as unprofessional and unfair as the initial insistence on delayed paper check refund itself. \n",

Motion was mailed to XXXX XXXX 's district court on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and was filed with the court on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX attorney for Mariner Finance issued a writ of garnishment of wages to be served on my employer. I am the only income for my family. My wife and I have XXXX children from the ages of XXXX months to XXXX years old. I have told Mariner Finance that I am the head of my household and they are tying up money that my family needs to survive. In response Mariner Finance has tied up even more money. They already have my bank account money held up with the courts and now they are trying to take 25 % of my paycheck that we now need all of for basic necessities ( electricity, water, food, medical, gas, insurance, etc. ) in addition to trying to pay an attorney to help us. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX manager XXXX informed me that XXXX XXXX XXXX could not release the funds placed on hold because XXXX XXXX attorney for Mariner Finance submitted the writ of garnishment claiming Mariner Finance was a state agency which made the garnishment in violation of Maryland statute 11-603 legal. Please investigate this claim as perjury to XXXX XXXX 's District court. Mariner Finance is a private institution and not a state agency in any capacity. \n",

Yes, that is me. The only reason I was notified about this garnishment is because my job notified me. Please keep in my that my job tried to stop the garnishment because they have been doing this for a few years now. They then threatened to go after my employer. They are acting on behalf of XXXX which is now XXXX XXXX. We spoke with them and they told us that they are acting in an illegal matter. We have consulted with an attorney. They acted illegally by first filing a lawsuit in a county that we have never lived in. We went down to XXXX County to get the entire case file. They have never filed in our county that we lived in. No one has ever served us at all. This is n't about whether we owe a debt or not from 11 years ago. This is about their practices. We have also filed a complaint with the consumer agency in georgia. We have mailed a demand letter to XXXX County, demanding that they cancel this garnishment and our reasons why. We have faxed a copy of this letter to the Law firm/collections agency as well. We received notification that the fax succeeded. We also sent a letter to them as well. Lastly we have filed a complaint through the attorney generals office. We are also prepared to file a civil suit demanding that wages that have been garnished, be repaid, if it is n't stopped immediately. You can not go around illegally garnishing wages through illegal procedures. Our attorney says that we have a very good case and that they are in violation of the fdcpa as well on how they went about collecting this debt. If they want to contact me, they can. Not regarding collecting this debt though. This is regarding how they can avoid legal action period. My phone number is not for them to call me trying to collect this debt either. \n",

The debtor failure to conduct adequate due diligence to determine the accuracy of the debt they are trying to collect after gaining knowledge of the disagreement with Apartment management and continuing to try to collect resulted in violation of the FCRA.

A party who has lost something due to fraud is entitled to file a lawsuit for damages against the party acting fraudulently, and the damages may include punitive damages as a punishment or public example due to the malicious nature of the fraud. Quite often there are several persons involved in a scheme to commit fraud and each and all may be liable for the total damages. Inherent in fraud is an unjust advantage over another which injures that person or entity. It includes failing to point out a known mistake in a contract. There is a known mistake in a contract that was never pointed out to me by my broker. It also includes failing to not reveal a fact which he or she has a duty to communicate, such as not delivering promised amenities. My broker promised amenities including a tanning bed and garages as originally understood. The amenities of a tanning bed and garages were not delivered to me as promised. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty such as lying about advertising amenities that were not delivered. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty without direct proof of fraud or fraudulent intent. Extrinsic fraud occurs when deceit is employed to keep someone from exercising a right, such as a fair trial, by hiding evidence or misleading the opposing party in a lawsuit.\n",

Two days later, I get a phone call from the director that she did get it, denied it and was sorry that nothing was sent out to inform me. Like I said, there are no signed documents from me agreeing to take out any such loan through XXXX college. When asked to see the XXXX, I was told they did n't keep them on file, after contacting XXXX, they do n't have it on file either since it was never filed to begin with AND apparently do n't keep XXXX over a certain amount of time. I have copies of all documentation between the school and myself regarding my past overrides that were approved and the paperwork about the one that was n't approved. None of it makes sense. Please help. I am now XXXX of dollars in school debt over a degree I was 3 months shy of getting because of something the school decided that was completely out of my control. \n",

      "Harassment. Debt collectors may not harass, oppress, or abuse you or any third parties they contact. For example, they may not : use threats of violence or harm ; publish a list of names of people who refuse to pay their debts ( but they can give this information to the credit reporting companies ) ; use obscene or profane language ; or repeatedly use the phone to annoy someone. \n",
      "False statements. Debt collectors may not lie when they are trying to collect a debt. For example, they may not : falsely claim that they are attorneys or government representatives ; falsely claim that you have committed a crime ; falsely represent that they operate or work for a credit reporting company ; misrepresent the amount you owe ; indicate that papers they send you are legal forms if they are n't ; or indicate that papers they send to you are n't legal forms if they are. \n",
      "Debt collectors also are prohibited from saying that : you will be arrested if you do n't pay your debt ; they 'll seize, garnish, attach, or sell your property or wages unless they are permitted by law to take the action and intend to do so ; or legal action will be taken against you, if doing so would be illegal or if they do n't intend to take the action. \n",
      "Debt collectors may not : give false credit information about you to anyone, including a credit reporting company ; send you anything that looks like an official document from a court or government agency if it is n't ; or use a false company name. \n",
      "Unfair practices. Debt collectors may not engage in unfair practices when they try to collect a debt. For example, they may not : try to collect any interest, fee, or other charge on top of the amount you owe unless the contract that created your debt - or your state law - allows the charge ; deposit a post-dated check early ; take or threaten to take your property unless it can be done legally ; or contact you by postcard.\n",

      "Can't repay my loan Can't decrease my monthly payments With the downturn in the economy, I was faced with some tough decisions ; to plod along and hope things got better or to go to school in pursuit of a degree. I chose the later but with that decision came the need to access student loans, which have only increased personal stress because I 've reached a juncture of needing to finish with an XXXX Degree and then go onto to acquiring a XXXX Degree. I can not even afford to finish with the credits needed for the XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I was forced to make another difficult decision and I filed for Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy. Now, I know that Congress repealed discharging of XXXX, but, it is wrong that this government is making huge profits in high-interest loans from students who simply wish to better their station in life. We are taxpayers and in essence, make it possible for the government to loan us money we 've paid into the system in the first place. This government spends trillions in support of other countries and many of those countries ( like XXXX ) provide free tuition for those who wish to continue their education after high school. It is morally wrong for a country that spends XXXX dollars in funding the XXXX Military XXXX, taxpayer subsidies to corporations who outsource American jobs, the bail-out of XXXX XXXX at the tune of XXXX dollars, which to date amounts to close to XXXX dollars ... .all, again, at the American taxpayers expense.This government 's solution for assisting student 's with their debt? Determining their yearly income ( mine before taxes was around XXXX ) and basing a pay-back plan on that income. The amount I was told I would need to pay was XXXX per month. That would relegate me to XXXX per year in payments on XXXX, alone. My rent debt amounts to approximately XXXX per year. So ... .you can see that right now, before taxes, that would bring the total for just these XXXX debts to XXXX over a years time. I have to ask if our government has simply lost all sense of reality ( it certainly appears to be the case ), in which case you should get out of your taxpayer paid salaried political seats and join the real world. I am thoroughly disgusted in this government that I 've always defended. No longer can I defend a government that appears to be about serving party interests and pandering to XXXX XXXX rather than serving the people ... .you know ... .the XXXX %! Now, considering the total of just those XXXX debts ... .and take those amounts out of pre-taxed income, not considering any other living expenses ; do you not consider your objectives absurd. If not, you should, because you will be judged on you have grossly betrayed the American people in lieu of serving the dictates of your corporate master ; XXXX XXXX. I am sure my post will not be considered cow-towing ... which I am pretty sure is expected. But as elected leaders, and all tens of thousands of bureaucracies taxpayers make possible, is n't the term 'serving the people ' a fallacy? Should n't the term be ; 'taxpayers serving their government ' a far more appropriate term? Repaying this debt is going to be a major hardship. I am no longer a spring chicken ( sorry for the cliche ) but I continue to work hard. It grieves me to think that we come into this world with a relative few years to adulthood and then the remainder is serving our government without any of the perks we taxpayers have earned. Our government is rewarded for doing what, exactly? Yes, I am angry. I 've tried the positive energy route, to no avail. Stop punishing students and start rewarding those who excel in college with high GPA 's. My own GPA started out at XXXX and I ended with a XXXX. We students who are mired in debt need realistic solutions instead of the same old, very predictable responses from our elected 'leaders '! I 'm running out of characters, but I 've said what I need to say. Thank you.\n",

In XXXX XXXX I got notice that a default judgement was ordered against me for the amount that I had proven already paid plus court costs. I had gotten Notice of Appeal or Court date ... ONLY the judgement. I went to XXXX and immediately filed a petition to srike the judgement ( i becane an XXXX in 4 hours )!

After many hours of frustrating phone calls I do not know what else they need to remove this negative from my file. I have paid Synchrony, proven that in a US court, paid additional money to file petitions, won that, travel to XXXX, fax and mail several pges of documents on more that one occassion and they STILL do not have enough evidence! Synchrony handed the case to a debt collector. Contacting them INSTEAD of the debt collector will keep me in the same place since my court documents are not enough for these credit bureaus.

      "Dealing with my lender or servicer Received bad information about my loan I began receiving phone calls from a place that was calling itself \" DM. '' They would not state what this acronym represented, and instead said, \" Oh, you do n't know? I think you do. '' They would ask for my birthdate and social security number. Obviously, no sane individual gives their Birthdate and Social Security Number to someone who wo n't identify themselves and attempts to obtain personal information. I sent this organization a \" Cease and Desist. '' They then contacted my workplace and spoke with the Administrative Assistant for my department. They attempted to obtain personal information about me from her. She provided me with their contact information. I called them again to state that they needed to stop. They said they would not talk to me unless I provided them with my Social Security Number and Date of Birth. Without receiving a single document from them, a \" Notice Prior to Wage Withholding '' was sent to the Payroll division of my place of employment. The Payroll Officer provided me with this document. In response, on XXXX XXXX, 2016, I sent them a letter indicating that their actions are illegal. My place of employment said that they then received a notice to stop the wage garnishment. I thought that that was the end of this matter with Delta Management Associates , Inc . They have provided no debt validation, claiming that they can not do so unless I give them my Social Security Number and Date of Birth over the telephone. I have requested that they verify the existence of this debt, which is not listed on my credit, and which I did not enter into with any organization. I have absolutely {$0.00} in student loan debt, and I attended an online program, for which I was given a full scholarship. I maintained a XXXX GPA to keep that scholarship. I also have written documentation from the school indicating that I did not have any debts. Delta Management Associate 's claim that I owe more than {$50000.00} is absolutely ridiculous. The school was an in-state school with tuition of less than {$1600.00} for XXXX semesters. This student loan crisis is appalling and disgusting, and I do n't know why something is n't being done to stop this monumental fraud. Today, XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received another letter from the Payroll division of my place of employment. It is another \" Notice of Wage Withholding '' from Delta Management. When I immediately called to determine what was happening, I received the same treatment. They state that they can not talk to me unless I provide them with my Date of Birth and Social Security Number. I called to ask them for their fax number, and in order to receive that information, they state that I must give them personally identifying information. The telephone call was recorded on both ends. I want this matter permanently resolved. Delta Management needs to correct all of its records and cease contacting my current and future places of employment. They also need to stop engaging in illegal Administrative Wage Garnishments, which is not an authority granted to them : a third-party debt collection agency. They are in violation of the FDCPA and my state 's ( California ) Rosenthal Act. I expect this matter to be resolved immediately.\n",

The sales person was very nice and helped us pick out the perfect set for our need at the time. The sales person informed us of a credit company they were working with had a deal where we would not have to make any payments for 24 months. The only thing was that the credit company they were going through only allowed a {$1000.00} limited so we had to get XXXX credit cards totaling XXXX. We agreed and in a week we received our furniture and everything was great. Since we were not new to getting credit, we understood that interest rates would accumulate, so I called the company about a month later to ask about my account information and mailing address so I could send my payments and not accurate interest rates. The customer service person at Synchrony Financial informed me that they were not allowed to give out my account number over the phone and that they would send me a bill soon. A month later I called again and they still refused to give me my account number and stated the same thing that a bill would arrive soon and that I could start making payments. To make a long story short I never once received a bill. As time went on I knew they would send me a bill once I started to accrue interest. Well Instead of getting a bill I got a call from the collections dept at Synchrony Financial offering a settlement. I explained to them what was going on and we came to an agreement that I would just pay it and get it over with. The last time I heard from Synchrony Financial was XXXX XXXX, XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I get a letter from XXXX XXXX telling me I owed them {$970.00}.

Seven days later I email XXXX with the statements and a letter of XXXX balance. XXXX does their investigation and confirms that I still owe XXXX, and I am stumped.

I also challenge their authority to use my title/trust name in their correspondence. The Markind Law Group made a claim against my estate in which they are not the superior title holder. I am the holder in due course, they do not have a superior claim.When challenged on this aspect of their claim again vagueness and a lack of a coherent, competent response.

In good faith I negotiated with XXXX of the XXXX debt collecting companies a few years ago and I have been paying down this debt slowly. The other XXXX companies have been incessant in their continued pursuit. These are all open credit accounts debts and the debt collectors know that these debts are old and past the statute of limitations. They still proceeded to sue me. Now my professional reputation within the company I work for is very much negatively impacted, perhaps irreversibly. I have no idea what impact this wage garnishment issue will have on my future advancement chances and income earning potential. The imposed wage garnishment sums are so outlandish that I can not possibly stay financially viable ; I will crash. The XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX meltdown had terrible financial repercussions on my family and I. When people around me were declaring Chapter XXXX bankruptcy, I stuck it out and fought back in order to pay back loans. My house went into foreclosure three times and three times I saved it from this fate by providing mountains of bank-requested documentation, many times the day before the house went to auction. I am very proud of having achieved this. Unfortunately some of my debts went without recourse and I lamentably could not pay them back. I achieved new and promising employment XX/XX/XXXX and I was looking forward to a productive and contributory career advancement and now this. I find it appalling that the courts would allow for a lawsuit of this nature, in full knowledge that the cases fall outside of this state 's statute of limitations. My situation now is dire. After having fought back from the precipice more than once, I am besieged by an unlawful and unscrupulous turn of events. Mind you ; I successfully came back from the meltdown while dealing with both my mother and father 's illnesses and subsequent passing. I took care of them every day after work for four years. Would not have done it any other way. So kind folks, an act of God brought me to your website. Your mission statement and goals are so worthy I can not begin to express my sentiments. Thank God that a group like yours exists. Now, I ask for help. I am staring at a life ending on such a false note. Please help my family and I traverse this labyrinth and find true justice out of this terrible whirlwind. I thank you profusely from the bottom of my heart. God Bless You.\n",

I have spoken to the original creditor, and I have spoken to the debt collector. Both have stated that they do not have me in their records.

Both assure me that filing a dispute with XXXX would fix the problem, but I have done this twice and no deletion. XXXX has told me that upon investigation, The collections agancy, has replied that the debt is indeed mine. I have never lived in that apartment complex. The collections agency, Procollect, has given me the run around completely. They give me extension numbers, and email addresses that dont exist. They asked me to call them back with proof that they were reporting onto my XXXX account. I hung up the phone logged into XXXX, and called them back. They stated that no one by the name I was given works at that office. It literally took less that 10 minutes. Other times I have called and they connot fine the file in question. My bank has a debt resolution company that was assigned to my case. Except Procollect doesnt accept calls from 3rd parties. In dealing with Procollect, I have been yelled at, called a liar, and hung up on. I would hate to see how people who actually have a debt are treated.\n",

      "Taking/threatening an illegal action Threatened arrest/jail if do not pay I received a letter in XX/XX/XXXX from an attorney, Kenneth Davidson, stating I owe a debt of {$1100.00} including interest. I wrote him back requesting my entire file from his firm along with the original creditor 's file since I have no idea who this person is. From what I understand per the Colorado Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, this is what I, as a consumer, am allowed to request. He mailed back to me a copy of a NSF check in the amount of {$40.00} that I had written on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. This is all he sent me. Still having no idea who this person is, why I am just now being notified of a {$40.00} NSF check that incurred interest & not receiving any other information, I submitted all documents with my complaint to my Colorado Attorney General 's office. A server came to my home & gave me an Interrogatories form that I was supposed to fill out and return to this Kenneth Davidson attorney ( not the court ) within 14 days, a week later. I submitted this to the Attorney General 's office and received an email stating I need to find a lawyer because they do not give out legal advice. I did not feel comfortable filling a form out to someone that I do not know and am supposed to list very personal information. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a CC letter from an investigator at the Attorney Regulation Counsel to this XXXX XXXX stating that he failed to comply with the Colorado Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, he had the opportunity to respond to the letter, he was to send in documentation and also address me that he failed to comply with the Act. My case number with the investigation is XXXX, if you need this. XXXX XXXX sent both of us a multitude of paperwork that I have never received, along with, a court document with my signature on it from XX/XX/XXXX, stating I agreed to pay this debt. It is my signature, however, it is mortifying to think of where else my signature has been fraudulently used because I never signed any documents with or in front of this person. I received a letter yesterday stating that I will be held in contempt and will go to jail if I do not fill out another Interrogatories form immediately to his office. This morning, the Regulation Counsel investigator 's secretary called and told me that I needed to find a lawyer for the Interrogatories form while they still investigate. I feel XXXX XXXX has violated Colorado 's statutes 12-14-108 by charging interest, 12-14-109 by not providing me the original creditor 's information, 12-14-107 ( h ) false representation or implication that the consumer has engaged in any disgraceful conduct, 12-14-112 deceptive forms - making up false forms he supposedly sent to me, and the Colorado Defamation Law 18-13-105 Criminal libel from the horrible things he wrote about me to the Regulation Counsel investigator.

      "Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed Debt resulted from identity theft I recently filed a complaint against this company for attempting to collect a debt that is not mine. The complaint number is : XXXX The company responded saying they could not validate the debt and were updating my credit report to say \" disputed ''. This is not acceptable. I want this item that does not belong to me completely removed from my credit report. The company responding saying that the letter from XXXX relates to a data breach that happened after the account in question was opened. When reading the letter one can see that this is simply not the case. The letter says XXXX became AWARE of the breach on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and nowhere in the letter does it state that the breach happened on that date. Furthermore I have attached a letter from XXXX bank detailing the credit hack which occurred in XXXX. As this letter from XXXX is NOT dated one would have to utilize the toll free number on the letter to inquire about any dates or details relating to this debt. Below is the text from the original complaint : I am a victim of identity theft. Several years ago my bank, XXXX, had a data breach. My sensitive information including name, social security number, date of birth and address were sent to over 1,000 people. Several accounts were open in my name without my knowledge or consent. This account was opened as a result of this identity theft. I disputed this directly with the company and did get a response. Later after dealing with that XXXX had a major leak related to XXXX. I have attached documentation regarding this leak which includes contact information for XXXX Bank if you would like to verify the identity theft with the bank.\n",

They said that they would need to come out and go inside my house and see what was wrong with my phone lines and that it would be a minimum charge of {$250.00} and could be more, perhaps even {$500.00} or more depending on what they found. I asked them if I paid there fee for coming out and doing what ever they were going to do if they would guarantee that I would then have reliable service. They said they could make no such guarantee. I also explained to them that my phone worked fine. I checked with my phone company to see if there could be something wrong with my phone lines considering the fact that my phone worked fine. The phone company said that would not be the case if my phone was working fine. I called back to XXXX XXXX and told them the phone company said my phone lines were fine and to please restore my service. I made several more calls to XXXX XXXX over the next couple months and continued for that time to pay their bill even though I had no service. On my last call I told them that they were in breach of the contract because they failed to provide the service I had been paying for, and that I would stop paying their bill if they did not restore my service. They said again that my phone lines had to be the problem and they would come out and try to fix the lines for the minimum charge of {$250.00}. I said I was not willing to risk another {$250.00} and perhaps more on the basis of what I had found out from the phone company and that they would not guarantee I would have reliable service even if I paid their additional charges. I told them to cancel the service and to stop billing me because I was not going to pay a bill for non existent service. So I stopped paying the bill because I had no service but they continued to bill me for another 4 months. They then sent me to collections for that additional 4 months of service which I did not get, just as I had not received the last 3 months of service which I had paid for. So the net result is that I paid over {$250.00} for XXXX modems which are useless to me, I paid for XXXX months of service and received less that 3 months service. So altogether I paid {$250.00} for modems, about {$180.00} for XXXX months of service, and I now have a collection on my credit report that is negatively affecting my credit score such that the mortgage I am applying for is going to cost thousands of dollars more due to this collection showing on my credit report for {$120.00}.

Some were successfully settled, however, the accounts referred to Hanna & Assoc. were actively pursued by their debt collectors. When we submitted letters to dispute the debt, we never received any written information, acknowledgment or response. They intimidated us to pay the debt even when we had nothing left except money for food. On some accounts they brought lawsuits, which they knew we could not afford to hire an attorney, nor pay in full. We filed timely answers and also disputed the debts, however, on all occasions the court sided with Hanna. On numerous occasions we tried to communicate with them, and learned that in the process Hanna & Assoc were not dealing fairly. Through stress, duress and coercion so that we were not dragged back to court due to no income, no gas money, and also times when we were told by Hanna that the account was settled and court was not necessary to attend because Hanna was going to vacate judgment. And we were afraid that we may be garnished with NOTHING TO PAY OUR BILLS! After that incident and Hanna 's repeated threats we agreed to pay {$5.00} to {$45.00} on various accounts. While paying these amounts either by automatic deduction or submitting a payment by check we ran into conflicts between one debt collector and another. My husband was unemployed from XXXX.

He is still unemployed [ unemployment was only for 3 months ], and all we have is our social security to live on which does not meet our basic necessities.

OUR COMPLAINT IS : BY WHAT AUTHORITY DOES COOLING AND WINTER HAVE OF OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION? WE DID NOT RECEIVE ANY NOTICE FROM HANNA THAT THIS DEBT WAS TRANSFERRED NOR ASSIGNED TO COOLING AND WINTER. Also the balance claimed we owed on their letter is erroneous. In addition, the address on the letterhead for Cooling and Winters shows the telephone number being the same as XXXX XXXX XXXX and the address that was used for Frederick J.Hanna and Associates XXXX is XXXX GA XXXX. Although there was a return address in XXXX MI XXXX. According to these actions, Hanna and their associates and representatives continue to use deceptive practices in collecting a debt. We will not send payment until we get an all clear from the CFPB on this investigation. Furthermore, on another Hanna and Associates account, XXXX, with no authority given by us, have deducted a payment from our checking account.
